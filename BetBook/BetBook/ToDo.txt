Current:
- Get notification above tabs when something happens

Docket:
- Seems to log me out after about 5 minutes in one instace (can set in debug mode and see if any errors present themselves)
- Potentially color the resolution time/offer expiry time by default
- An offer without an offer expiration but with a bet resolution date should probably erase itself?

- Consider packaging warnings so invalid username and bet amount follow each other, instead of one popping up per sent offer
- Current try parse on make a bet is for integers, that would prevent doubles from being used


- GET GOING ON THE APPLE VERSION OF THE PROJECT


Be easier with two phone:
- offers sent during login dont seem to appear
