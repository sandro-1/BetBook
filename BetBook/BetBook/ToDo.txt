Current:
- Finish changing all of the popups, then deal with the outside of the box click issue

- App entering break state after both the clocks are set.
- Dont forget back button handling for popup

Docket:
- GET GOING ON THE APPLE VERSION OF THE PROJECT
- Currently the final responses in active bets dont give any info to the movement of bets to settled - unpaid, that's a problem
- opponents requested settlement goes gray, only god knows why. fucking thing sucks.
- Don't allow settlement to be requested until resolution date?
- win pct needs setting up
- line underneath name may need to be adjusted to fill screen not be fixed lengths
- adj money rules for money figures place in the navbar, large amounts will throw off formatting. also limit name size for same reason
- What happens to my timers if app is closed or device is shut off?
- Consider other options for row with cash bet and toggle. maybe two buttons side by side with each option
- Consider packaging warnings so invalid username and bet amount follow each other, instead of one popping up per sent offer
- Current try parse on make a bet is for integers, that would prevent doubles from being used
- Add color to buttons in some way to indicate the messages are being received and sent
- When display alert pops up, clicking outside of box removes the box, presumably returning false?
- Make userresult more readable
- Settled Bets - Paid: label whether bet was won or lost
- Settled Bets - Unpaid: label whether bet was won or lost
- Clear login info on logout
- make offersreceived tab move to active bets? would be nice if there was just one offer received, problematic if there were multiple
offers the user was interested in viewing
- Sort out collection ratios. Should they start at 1 or 0?
- reverse the display "yes" and "no" positions in activebetsviewmodel
