TEST THE ADDITIONS TO THE TERMSHEETS ON THE EACH OF THE PAGES

MOVE THE PROJECT INTO THE CLOUD AND ALSO TO GET GOING ON THE APPLE VERSION OF THE PROJECT

Docket:
- What happens to my timers if app is closed or device is shut off?
- Consider other options for row with cash bet and toggle. maybe two buttons side by side with each option
- Consider packaging warnings so invalid username and bet amount follow each other, instead of one popping up per sent offer
- Current try parse on make a bet is for integers, that would prevent doubles from being used
- Add color to buttons in some way to indicate the messages are being received and sent
- When display alert pops up, clicking outside of box removes the box, presumably returning false?
- Make userresult more readable
- Settled Bets - Paid: label whether bet was won or lost
- Settled Bets - Unpaid: label whether bet was won or lost
- Clear login info on logout
- make offersreceived tab move to active bets? would be nice if there was just one offer received, problematic if there were multiple
offers the user was interested in viewing
- Sort out collection ratios. Should they start at 1 or 0?
- reverse the display "yes" and "no" positions in activebetsviewmodel
